The website includes multiple logically connected pages:

1. **Home Page** – Main introduction with hero banner and features.  
2. **Menu / Services Page** – Displays special cards with hover animations.  
3. **Gallery Page** – Image gallery with click-to-enlarge modal and smooth fade effects.  
4. **About Page** – Information about the brand or restaurant.  
5. **Contact Page** – Form with validation and scroll-to-top button.

All pages share the same **header, footer, and navigation menu** for consistent design.
